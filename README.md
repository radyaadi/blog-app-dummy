Hi Everyone ! I am [Radya Adi Anggara](https://radya-profiles.netlify.app/). This is my blog app I created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 

Previously we apologized for the error on the [GoRest API](https://gorest.co.in/), so temporary web creation using dummy data locally.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
